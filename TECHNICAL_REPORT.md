## Problem Statement
*	**The Problem**: 
Everyday internet users are primary targets for a wide range of cyber threats, including phishing, social engineering scams, malware, and data theft. Many individuals lack the technical expertise to accurately identify a suspicious email, recognize a fraudulent website from a screenshot, or assess the security of a public Wi-Fi network. This knowledge gap makes them vulnerable to financial loss, identity theft, and privacy invasion.

*	**Current Gaps**:
While enterprise-grade security tools exist, they are often too complex and expensive for personal use. Standard antivirus software provides baseline protection but cannot offer real-time, contextual analysis of user-specific queries (e.g., "Is this email I just received a scam?"). Existing consumer advice is often static, found in blog posts or articles, and fails to provide the interactive, immediate feedback needed when a user faces a potential threat.

*	**Why an AI/Chatbot?**:
An AI-powered chatbot is the ideal solution because it provides an accessible, non-judgmental, and instantaneous "first line of defense." It can analyze user-provided data (text, images) in context, offering personalized, easy-to-understand security advice 24/7. This democratizes cybersecurity expertise, making it available to anyone with a web browser.

## Proposed Solution
*	**Chatbot Description**:
CyGuard is an all-in-one cybersecurity assistant delivered through a user-friendly web interface. At its core is an interactive chat where users can paste suspicious text, URLs, or describe a situation. The bot uses a specialized AI flow to assess the threat, estimate a risk level, and provide concrete action steps. This core functionality is augmented by a suite of dedicated tools for more specific tasks, such as analyzing screenshots for visual signs of phishing or checking an email against known data breaches, making CyGuard a comprehensive personal security toolkit.

*	**Key Features**:
    *   **Interactive Threat Assessment**: Analyzes user text and chat history to provide real-time risk analysis.
    *   **Screenshot Analysis**: Scrutinizes uploaded images for visual red flags of phishing and scams.
    *   **Wi-Fi "Evil Twin" Hunter**: Helps users identify potentially malicious public Wi-Fi networks.
    *   **Data Breach Checker**: Allows users to check if their email has appeared in known data breaches.
    *   **Security Log Analysis**: Scans snippets of technical logs for anomalies and threats.
    *   **Threat Intelligence Feed**: Displays a curated list of recent, real-world cyber threats.
    *   **Secure Authentication**: Features a full user sign-up and login system using Firebase Authentication.

*	**Benefits**:
CyGuard enhances user security by translating complex threat analysis into simple, actionable advice. It empowers users to make informed decisions in real-time, preventing potential security incidents before they occur. By providing a centralized suite of tools, it simplifies personal cybersecurity and fosters better security habits.

## Related Work
*	**Existing Solutions**:
Several general-purpose AI chatbots (like ChatGPT or Gemini) can offer cybersecurity advice if prompted correctly. Additionally, services like "Have I Been Pwned" provide excellent data breach checking. Antivirus companies (e.g., Norton, McAfee) also offer security suites. However, these solutions are often fragmented. General chatbots lack the specialized, pre-built security workflows, and standalone services require users to navigate to multiple different websites for different tasks.

*	**Enhancements**:
CyGuard's primary enhancement is its **integration**. It combines the functionality of multiple specialized security tools into a single, conversational interface. Unlike general-purpose chatbots, its AI flows are specifically designed for security tasks, with structured inputs and outputs for greater reliability (e.g., providing a consistent 0-10 risk score). The seamless transition between a general chat and specialized tools like the screenshot or Wi-Fi analyzer is a unique user experience that is not commonly found in consumer security products.

## Proposed System Architecture
*	**High-Level Diagram**:
```
[User's Browser] <--> [Next.js Frontend (React, ShadCN UI)]
       |
       | (Server Actions)
       v
[Next.js Backend] <--> [Firebase Auth & Firestore]
       |
       | (Genkit AI Flows)
       v
[Google AI Platform (Gemini Models)]
```
The architecture is a modern web application with a Next.js frontend and backend. The user interacts with the UI, which calls server actions. These actions trigger specific Genkit AI flows that interface with Google's Gemini models to perform analysis. User authentication is handled by Firebase.

*	**Integration**:
    *   **Genkit**: Acts as the core AI orchestration framework, defining the structure of prompts, tools, and flows that call the language models.
    *   **Google AI (Gemini)**: The underlying LLM used for natural language understanding, threat analysis, and content generation.
    *   **Firebase**: Provides secure user authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In) and serves as a potential backend database (Firestore).
    *   **Next.js Server Actions**: Used as the secure bridge between the client-side components and the server-side AI logic, ensuring that API keys and sensitive operations are never exposed to the browser.

## Proposed Technology Stack
*	**Core Technologies**:
    *   **AI/ML Models**: Google Gemini series (e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash) accessed via the `@genkit-ai/googleai` plugin.
    *   **Frameworks**: Next.js (App Router) for the full-stack web application, React for building the user interface.
    *   **AI Framework**: Genkit for defining and running structured AI flows.
    *   **UI Components**: ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS for a modern, responsive, and aesthetically pleasing user interface.
    *   **Programming Languages**: TypeScript (primarily), CSS.

*	**Deployment**:
    *   The application is designed for seamless deployment on serverless platforms like **Vercel**, which natively supports Next.js applications.
    *   **Firebase Hosting** is also a viable alternative for deploying the frontend and leveraging its tight integration with other Firebase services.

## Use Cases & Scenarios
*	**Scenario 1: User Receives a Suspicious Email**
    *   A user receives an email from their "bank" asking them to click a link to verify their account. They are unsure if it's real.
    *   **User Action**: The user copies the text of the email and pastes it into the CyGuard chat interface.
    *   **Chatbot Response**: CyGuard's `assessThreat` flow analyzes the text. It identifies urgent language ("account will be suspended") and a generic greeting. It flags this as a high-risk phishing attempt (e.g., Threat Level: 9/10), displays a list of recommended actions ("1. Do not click the link. 2. Delete the email. 3. If you are concerned, visit your bank's website by typing the address directly into your browser."), and includes a privacy note reminding the user not to share personal info.

*	**Scenario 2: User Wants to Analyze a Suspicious Text Message Screenshot**
    *   A user gets an SMS with a strange link about a package delivery.
    *   **User Action**: The user takes a screenshot of the message, clicks the "paperclip" icon in the chat, and uploads the image.
    *   **Chatbot Response**: The `analyzeScreenshot` flow is triggered. The AI analyzes the image, identifies the suspicious URL and the urgent call to action. It returns a structured analysis card in the chat, stating "This appears to be a smishing (SMS phishing) attempt. The URL is not from a known delivery service." It assigns a high risk score and lists red flags like "unsolicited link" and "impersonation of a delivery service."

*	**Scenario 3: User is at an Airport and Needs to Use Wi-Fi**
    *   A user sees two networks: "Free_Airport_Wi-Fi" and "Airport_Guest_Secure".
    *   **User Action**: The user opens the "Wi-Fi Hunter" tool from the sidebar and enters both network names, marking the first as "Open".
    *   **Chatbot Response**: The `analyzeWifiNetworks` flow assesses the inputs. It flags "Free_Airport_Wi-Fi" as high-risk (e.g., Risk: 8/10), explaining that such open networks are common "Evil Twin" attacks. It rates "Airport_Guest_Secure" as lower risk, recommending it as the safer option.

## Evaluation Plan
*	**Success Metrics**:
    *   **Accuracy of Threat Detection**: The percentage of correctly identified threats (phishing, malware links, etc.) when tested against a curated dataset of safe and malicious inputs.
    *   **User Satisfaction**: Measured via a simple in-app feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down on AI responses) and short surveys. A target satisfaction score of over 85% will be aimed for.
    *   **Task Completion Rate**: The percentage of users who successfully complete a core task (e.g., get a result from the Wi-Fi hunter, analyze a screenshot).
    *   **Response Time**: Average time from user submission to AI response, aiming for under 5 seconds for most text-based queries.

*	**Evaluation Tools**:
    *   **Internal Testing Suite**: A predefined set of prompts and images to test the accuracy and consistency of the AI flows.
    *   **User Feedback Forms**: Simple, non-intrusive forms or buttons integrated into the UI to collect feedback on the quality of AI responses.
    *   **Analytics**: Anonymized tracking of feature usage to understand which tools are most popular and effective.

## Future Enhancements
*	**Real-time URL Scanning**: Integrate a backend service to actively scan URLs submitted by users for malware and phishing threats, providing more definitive results than text-based analysis alone.
*	**Browser Extension**: Develop a companion browser extension that allows users to send suspicious content or the current page URL directly to CyGuard for analysis without leaving the page.
*	**Personalized Security Dashboard**: Create a dashboard for logged-in users that provides a summary of their activity and personalized security tips based on the threats they've encountered.
*	**Multilingual Support**: Expand the chatbot's language capabilities to serve a global audience.
*	**Voice Input**: Allow users to describe a threat using their voice for increased accessibility.

## Challenges
*	**Anticipated Challenges**:
    *   **AI Hallucinations**: The risk of the LLM providing incorrect or fabricated security advice, which could have serious consequences.
    *   **Evolving Threat Landscape**: Cyber threats evolve constantly, requiring the AI's knowledge base and analysis techniques to be continuously updated.
    *   **User Trust**: Convincing users to trust an AI with potentially sensitive, security-related questions. The "black box" nature of AI can be a barrier.
    *   **Over-Reliance**: Users may become over-reliant on the tool and neglect fundamental security practices.

*	**Mitigation**:
    *   **Structured AI Flows**: Using Genkit with strict input/output schemas (Zod) and detailed system prompts minimizes hallucinations and ensures consistent, structured responses.
    *   **Continuous Improvement Loop**: Implement a feedback mechanism where flagged or poor responses can be reviewed to fine-tune prompts and training data. The threat intel feed helps keep the system aware of new trends.
    *   **Transparency and Privacy-First Design**: Being transparent about the tool's capabilities and limitations. A strong privacy policy and not storing chat history are crucial for building trust.
    *   **User Education**: The chatbot will consistently reinforce good security principles and explain the "why" behind its recommendations, aiming to educate users rather than just providing an answer.
